## Usage
### Setup
* Clone the repository on your web server
* Download [pgn4web][2] on your web server
* Edit the `pgn4web.js` path and the fonts path in `index.html` and in `mosaic-tile.html`  
(in my case, pgn4web-3.04 is placed one directory up)
```html
<script src="../pgn4web-3.04/pgn4web.js"></script>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../pgn4web-3.04/fonts/pgn4web-font-ChessSansUsual.css">
```
and the image path for the pieces in `assets/js/setup.js`
```javascript
SetImagePath("../pgn4web-3.04/images");
```

* Upload / broadcast your PGN files on the server, and define their locations in `assets/js/setup.js` in the `listPGNFiles()` function. For instance:
```javascript
function listPGNFiles() {
    // If broadcasting a tournament
    allPGNs.push(["Round 1 - dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm", "pgn/r1.pgn"])
    allPGNs.push(["Round 2 - dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm", "pgn/r2.pgn"])
    // ...
    // And / or if you just want to display some PGN files
    allPGNs.push(["Display name for PGN file", "pgn/file.pgn"])
    // ...
}
```
### Customization
In `index.html` you can:
* edit the general information about the tournament
* add / edit buttons for hyperlinks

In `assets/js/setup.js` you can configure:
* in `operatorSettings()` edit the links to already defined buttons and name of the operator
* some default options (such as autoplay delay, move highlighting etc.)
* number of miniboards for the multiple boards view
```javascript
let numberMiniboards = 6;
```

In `assets/style.css` you can configure all the colors used on the page. It comes with a predefined light and dark theme.
```css
/* Light theme example preset */
:root {
    /* Background color and text */
    --bg-color: #F3F3F3;
    --bg-color-text: #000;
    /* A variant of background color used for text-area / input fields and dropdown-menus */
    --bg-color-light: #ddd;
    --bg-color-light-text: #000;
    /* Lighter background test color used for games and move ordinal numbers */
    --bg-color-text-light: #999;
    /* Colors when hovering move or game elements for selection */
    --bg-color-hover: #1B78D0;
    --bg-color-hover-text: #fff;
    /* Color of active (selected) game and move */
    --bg-color-active: #D1E4F6;
    /* Custom color for buttons, background of player names and more */
    --first-color-bg: #DCDCDC;
    --first-color-text: #000;
    /* Color when hovering first-color elements */
    --first-color-hover: #999;
    /* Chess board colors */
    --white-square: #F0D9B5;
    --black-square: #B58863;
    --highlight-white-sq: #CDD26A;
    --highlight-black-sq: #AAA23A;
}
```
