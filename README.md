A demo is available on: http://hrvatski-sahovski-savez.hr/ftp/sucelje_patrick/

### Features
* Banner with general information about the tournament and customizable buttons for hyperlinks (other websites, photo gallery, tournament regulations etc.) 
* Chess board with compactly displayed player names, clock times and ratings
* PGN section for display and navigation
* Engine analysis
* Switching between different games and rounds on the same page
* Download PGN / FEN of the current game, round or whole tournament
* Mobile phone friendly

### Usage
* Clone the repository on your web server
* Download [pgn4web][2] on your web server
* Edit the `pgn4web.js` path in `index.html` (in my case, pgn4web-3.03 is placed one directory up)
```html
<script src="../pgn4web-3.03/pgn4web.js"></script>
```
and the image path for the pieces in `assets/js/setup.js`
```javascript
SetImagePath("../pgn4web-3.03/images");
```

* Upload / broadcast your PGN files on the server, and define their locations in `assets/js/setup.js` in the `operaterSettings()` function. For instance:
```javascript
function operaterSettings() {
    allPGNs.push(["Round 1 - dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm", "pgn/r1.pgn"])
    //...
}
```
You can also do further customization in the same function. To edit the general informations and add / edit buttons for hyperlinks, go directly in the `index.html` file.

### Notes
* The page is currently in Croatian. With little effort, it can be translated to any language
* The repository includes sample PGN files from the [42nd Chess Olympiad][4], which are present only for illustrational purposes
