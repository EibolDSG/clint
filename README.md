## Usage
### Setup
* Clone this repository on your web server
* Download [pgn4web][2] on your web server
* Edit the `pgn4web.js` path and the fonts path in `index.html` and in `mosaic-tile.html`  
(in my case, pgn4web-3.04 is placed one directory up)
```html
<script src="../pgn4web-3.04/pgn4web.js"></script>
...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="../pgn4web-3.04/fonts/pgn4web-font-ChessSansUsual.css">
```
and the image path for the pieces in `assets/js/setup.js`
```javascript
SetImagePath("../pgn4web-3.04/images");
```

* Upload / broadcast your PGN files on the server, and define their locations in `assets/js/setup.js` in the `listPGNFiles()` function. For instance:
```javascript
function listPGNFiles() {
    // If broadcasting a tournament
    allPGNs.push({
        "name" : "Round 1",
        "pgn" : "pgn/r1.pgn"
    });
    allPGNs.push({
        "name" : "Round 2",
        "pgn" : "pgn/r2.pgn"
    });
    // ...
    allPGNs.push({
        "name" : "Archive",
        "pgn" : "pgn/all.pgn"
    });

    // And / or if you just want to display some PGN files (ended tournaments)
    allPGNs.push({
        "name" : "Tournament (last year's edition)",
        "pgn" : "pgn/last_year.pgn",
        "video-left" : "https://www.youtube.com/embed/<your-code>",
        "video-right" : "https://www.youtube.com/embed/<your-code>",
        "image-left" : "<image-url>",
        "image-right" : "<image-url>"
    });
    // ...
}
```
### Customization
In `index.html` you can:
* edit the general information about the tournament

In `assets/js/setup.js` you can:
* in `operatorSettings()` edit hyperlinks. For instance:
```javascript
footerLinks.push({
    "text" : "Photo Gallery",
    "link" : "https://www.example.com"
});
``` 
* some default options (such as autoplay delay, move highlighting etc.)
* number of miniboards for the multiple boards view
```javascript
let numberMiniboards = 6;
```

In `assets/style.css` you can configure all the colors used on the page. It comes with a predefined light and dark theme.
```css
/* Light theme example preset */
:root {
    --bg-color: #eee;
    --bg-color-text: #111;
    --bg-color-light: #ddd;
    --bg-color-light-text: #111;
    --bg-color-text-light: #888;
    --bg-color-hover: #27c;
    --bg-color-hover-text: #eee;
    --bg-color-active: #cde;
    --main-color-bg: #ddd;
    --main-color-text: #000;
    --main-color-hover: #cccf;
    --main-color-border: #bbb;
    --white-square: #f0d9b5;
    --black-square: #b58863;
    --highlight-white-sq: #cdd26a;
    --highlight-black-sq: #aaa23a;
